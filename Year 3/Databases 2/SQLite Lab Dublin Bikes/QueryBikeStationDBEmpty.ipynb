    "Run the program CreateBikeStationDB to create the database dubbikes.db.  This program opens the SQlite database dubbikes.db that was created by CreateBikeStationDB for querying.  When you have finished writing and running your queries, close the database.\n",

    " ### Things to note:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - The SQL query should be enclosed in pd.read_sql_query(\"    \",conn)\n",
    "  - If you are not using Jupyter Notebook, you will need it to be in a PRINT statement\n",
    "      - print(pd.read_sql_query(\"    \",conn)) where conn is the connection.\n",
    "  - Differences from Oracle SQL:\n",
    "      - use the word except instead of minus\n",
    "      - limit 3 limits the number of rows returned to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Remember:\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Although this data is in a database, it is not normalized or validated and there are no keys."
