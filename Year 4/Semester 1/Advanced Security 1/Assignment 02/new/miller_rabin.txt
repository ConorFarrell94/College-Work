In this example, the is_prime() function takes a number n and a parameter k as input. The function first checks if the number is small and either 2 or 3, in which case it returns True (since those numbers are prime by definition). If the number is 1 or is even, it returns False (since 1 is not prime and even numbers are not prime except for 2).

Next, the function uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that divides n - 1. This value is stored in the s and d variables.

Then, the function uses a loop to test the number k times. For each iteration, it generates a random number a between 2 and n - 1 (inclusive), and then uses the pow() function to calculate a^d mod n. If this value is not 1 or n - 1, it uses another loop to test if x is a non-trivial square root of 1 modulo n. If it finds such a value, it returns False (since this indicates that the number is not prime).

If the number passes all of these tests, the function returns True, indicating that it is likely to be prime. The likelihood of a false positive (a composite number being reported as prime) can be controlled by adjusting the k parameter. A larger value of k will increase the number of tests and reduce the likelihood of a false positive, but it will also increase the runtime of the algorithm.
